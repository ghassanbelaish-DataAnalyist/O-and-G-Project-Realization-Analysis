O&amp;G Project Realization Analysis


Project Overview
This project analyzes the intricate relationship between oil production volumes, reserves, and natural resource rents across major producing nations globally. The scope of this analysis covers global data spanning from 1970 to 2025.


Key Focus Areas:

Production trends and growth patterns.
Reserve management strategies.
Economic impact through natural resource rents.
Comparative analysis of top producers (The "Big Three").

📈 Key Visualizations

(Above all: Global oil production has seen a massive 300%+ increase over five decades, reaching over 200,000 MB/D by 2025.)

💡 Major Findings
The Production Surge
Global oil production has more than doubled since 1970.
The baseline in the 1970s was approximately 50,000 MB/D, experiencing a sharp jump to ~120,000 MB/D by 1980, and peaking over 200,000 MB/D in 2025.
The Production-Reserve-Rent Relationship

Reserves: High production does not strictly equal reserve depletion. Countries maintain or grow reserves through new discoveries, technology improvements, and enhanced recovery methods.

Economic Impact: Higher production volumes don't automatically translate to higher economic rents. Rents peaked around 1980 during the oil crisis era, but recent trends show declining rent percentages despite higher production.

Dependency Variances: 
* High Dependency (10-20% of GDP): Russia and the Middle East.
Moderate Dependency: 5-10% of GDP.
Diversified Economies (<5% of GDP): USA (despite having high production).


"The Big Three" (USA, Saudi Arabia, Russia)

Production Leaders: The US leads at ~500K MB/D, followed by Saudi Arabia at ~450K MB/D, and Russia at ~300K MB/D.

Shared Strategies: All three maintain significant proven reserves, actively invest in exploration/technology, and use reserves as geopolitical and economic tools.
Diverging Trajectories: The US saw massive growth driven by the shale revolution, Saudi Arabia has maintained steady high production, and Russia has seen stable growth post-1990s.

🎯 Strategic Recommendations
For High-Production Countries:

Diversify Economic Base: High rent dependency creates vulnerability. Countries should target reducing natural resource rents to <10% of GDP while maintaining production, following the USA model.
Invest in Reserve Sustainability: Balance production growth with reserve replacement by increasing exploration investment, adopting enhanced recovery technologies, and developing unconventional resources.
Optimize Production Efficiency: Leverage technology for cost reduction and focus on high-margin assets to maintain competitiveness amid volatile prices.


For Industry Stakeholders:

Prepare for demand uncertainty by focusing on quality over quantity and developing flexible production capabilities.
Implement dynamic reserve assessments and monitor rent-to-production ratios closely.
